# Standards Updates

[TOC]

## Time Zones

Make sure the timezone (Olson) data is up to date.

Olson timezone data should be regularly updated in the trunk. If the data is out
of date, follow the instruction described in the
[readme](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/data/trunk/tzdata/readme.txt)
file.

Once the timezone resource file is generated by the process above, the file
should be checked into
[zoneinfo64.txt](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/master/icu4c/source/data/misc/zoneinfo64.txt)
in the trunk.

## Unicode

### Update Unicode Data

See the [Unicode Update page](../../uni-up.md) and the instructions in
[icu/trunk/source/data/unidata/changes.txt](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/master/icu4c/source/data/unidata/changes.txt)
and nearby files, also check the change log for this and related files such as
UnicodeData.txt.

### Update script code enums

Update script code enums with new codes from ISO 15924, send a notice for them
as public API (born @stable) to the icu-design list.

Starting with ICU 55, add script code enum constants only after assignment of
Unicode script property value aliases; otherwise the names of the constants may
become confusing.

Soon after a Unicode release, work to assign property value aliases for scripts
that are known to be added in the next version, then update ICU.

Constants for script codes like Latf and Aran that are not subject to separate
encoding may be added at any time.

See details in
[icu/trunk/source/data/unidata/changes.txt](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/master/icu4c/source/data/unidata/changes.txt)
and keep the list of script codes not yet in ICU up to date there.

For new codes see <http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/codechanges.html> (check for
recent changes with the code highlighted in the left column and "Add" in the
right column) and <http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry>
(Search for "Type: script" and look for recent "Added:" dates.) Discuss what to
do if these two sources are out of sync.

## CLDR

### Sync ICU with CLDR and tag CLDR.

Update ICU data from CLDR, tag CLDR. Instructions
[here](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/master/icu4c/source/data/cldr-icu-readme.txt).

### **Update MeasureUnit Code**

<https://docs.google.com/document/d/107GGhHSVypvnjdeyKOoJwCwjpBNxD2tDVcrEg9pgIs0/edit>

## ISO 4217 numeric codes

Make sure the ISO 4217 numeric code mapping data is up to date.

See the instruction in
<https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/master/tools/currency/readme.txt>
