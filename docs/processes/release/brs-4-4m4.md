**Make sure the timezone (Olson) data is up to date** M C & J FF, CF, GA

Olson timezone data should be regularly updated in the trunk. If the data is out
of date, follow the instruction described in the [
readme](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/data/trunk/tzdata/readme.txt)
file.

Once the timezone resource file is generated by the process above, the file
should be checked into [
zoneinfo.txt](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/source/data/misc/zoneinfo.txt)
in the trunk.

**ICU4C**:

1.  Update the API documentation in all header files (.h file) to have correct
    @draft/@stable/@deprecated labels.
2.  Update docmain.h
3.  ./configure
4.  make docs
5.  Follow instructions in [
    readme.txt](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/tools/trunk/release/java/readme.txt)
    to generate API status change report.
6.  Make sure that ICU headers work with U_HIDE_DRAFT_API and other such
    switches.
7.  Verify that U_DRAFT and U_STABLE match the @draft and @stable tags (same for
    other such pairs declaration macro vs. tag).

**ICU4J**:

Update the API documentation to have correct @draft/@stable/@deprecated labels.
On ICU4J, run [
com.ibm.icu.dev.tool.docs.CheckTags](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu4j/trunk/src/com/ibm/icu/dev/tool/docs/CheckTags.java)
(see file for instructions). This requires a Sun jdk with javadoc available. The
tool will need to change to reflect the release number to search for.

To check the API status changes, run the ant target "apireport" to gerate the
report since the previous official release.

Make sure @provisional is specified along with @draft, and @deprecated with
@internal. For example,

> \* @draft ICU 4.0
> \* @provisional This API might change or be removed in a future release.

> \* @internal
> \* @deprecated This API is ICU internal only.

yoshito **Make sure data file versions (for ==data contents==) are properly
assigned** C (data resides in the ICU4C repository) CF-2w

If any of the data files in [
/icu/source/data/](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/source/data/)
directory has changed **MANUALLY**, upgrade the version number accordingly as
well. If the contents of a resource bundle has changed, then increase the
version number (at least the minor version field). The CLDR generated data
should have the correct number.

**Note** from Markus (20090514, ICU 4.2 timeframe): Most data files
automatically get their version numbers set by the LDML2ICUConverter, from CLDR
version numbers. It is not clear what, if anything, needs to be done for this
task.

markus **Make sure data file ==format== versions are updated**
M C (generator and runtime code) & J (runtime code)
CF-2w

If the format of a binary data file has changed, upgrade the format version in
the UDataInfo header for that file. Better: Change the format version
immediately when the format is changed. The change must be made in both the
producer/generator and consumer/runtime code.

It is desirable to maintain backward compatibility, but sometimes impractical.
Update the major version number for incompatible changes. Runtime code should
permit higher minor version numbers for supported major versions.

We rarely use the third and fourth version number fields, except for UTrie
(version 1) parameters that don't really change.

markus **Scan for Copyright notices** C & J CF-1w

Check source and data files, especially newly contributed ones, to make sure the
proper copyright notice is in place. For example,

> Copyright (c) 2001-2008, International Business Machines Corporation
> and others. All rights reserved.

Scan the source code to make sure that every file that was touched recently has
the current year in the copyright statement. See the [ICU Copyright
Scanner](../copyright-scan.md) page and follow the link to the scripts and the
readme.

Scan the source code to include third-party company names in copyright notices
if necessary.

Scan for text files that do not contain the word "Copyright": find_textfiles
-nosvn -novc | xargs grep -i -L Copyright (See the find_textfiles Perl script
attached to this page.)

Make sure that you use `(c)`, not Â©, because non-ASCII characters in source code
can break the build!
(See [ICU's check-in policy](http://icu-project.org/copyright-scan.html) for
more details.)

jason **Update license files** C & J CF-1w

Check ICU, Unicode and other license terms. Make sure these files are up to

**Verify proper memory allocation functions**
C CF-2w

Verify the following for library code (common, i18n, layout, ustdio). The
requirement is for ICU's memory management to be customizable by changing
cmemory.h and the common base class.

*   No raw malloc/free/realloc but their uprv_ versions.
*   All C++ classes must inherit the common base class UObject or UMemory
    *   But not for mixin/interface classes (pure virtual, no data members, no
        constructors) because that would break the single-inheritance model.
    *   Also not for pure-static classes (used for name scoping) declare but
        don't implement a private default constructor to prevent instantiation.
    *   Simple struct-like C++ classes (and structs) that do not have
        constructors, destructors, and virtual methods, need not inherit the
        base class but must then be allocated with uprv_malloc.
*   All simple types (UChar, int32_t, pointers(!), ...) must be allocated with
    uprv_malloc and released with uprv_free.
*   For Testing that this is the case, on Linux
    *   run the Perl script ICUMemCheck.pl. Follow the instructions in the
        script. The script is in in the ICU4C sources at
        icu/tools/memcheck/ICUMemCheck.pl.
*   For testing that this is the case, on Windows:
    *   Don't bother, as of Nov, 2004. Failures appear in many dozens of files
        from the mixin class destructors. Do the check on Linux. But, for
        reference, here are the old instructions.
        *   Make sure that in uobject.h UObject::new and delete are defined by
            default. Currently, this means to grep to see that
            U_OVERRIDE_CXX_ALLOCATION is defined to 1 (in pwin32.h for Windows).
        *   Check the \*.obj's for linkage to the global (non-UObject::)
            operators new/delete; see uobject.cpp for details.
        *   Global new must never be imported. Global delete will be imported
            and used by empty-virtual destructors in interface/mixin classes.
            However, they are not called because implementation classes always
            derive from UMemory. No other functions must use global delete.
        *   There are now (2002-dec-17) definitions in utypes.h for global
            new/delete, with inline implementations that will always crash.
            These global new/delete operators are only defined for code inside
            the ICU4C libraries (but must be there for all of those). See
            Jitterbug 2581.
        *   If a global new/delete is used somewhere, then change the class
            inheritance and/or use uprv_malloc/free until no global new/delete
            are used in the libraries (and the tests still pass...). See the
            User Guide Coding Guidelines for details.

michael done **Run static code analysis tools (Purify, Boundary Checker,
valgrind...)** M C CF-2w Make sure we fixed all the memory leak problems that
were discovered when running these tools.

*   Build ICU with debug information. On Linux,
    runConfigureICU --enable-debug --disable-release Linux
*   Run all of the standard tests under valgrind. For intltest, for example
    cd <where ever>/source/test/intltest
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../lib:../../stubdata:../../tools/ctestfw:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    valgrind ./intltest
    You can grab the command line for running the tests from the output from
    "make check", and then just insert "valgrind" before the executable.

N/A - - **Try running tests without any ICU data** M C & J CF-1w

**ICU4C**:

ICU data should be removed, so that tests cannot access it. Both cintltst and
intltest should be run with -w option and they should not crash. Every crash
should be investigated and fixed.

**Test ICU4C headers** M C CF-1w

**Testing external dependencies in header files**:

(on Unixes) Prerequisite: Configure with --prefix
(../trunk/source/runConfigureICU Linux --prefix=/some/temp/folder) and do 'make
install'. Then set the PATH so that the installed icu-config script can be
found. (export PATH=/some/temp/folder==**/bin**==:$PATH)

Then go to the 'icu/source/test/hdrtst' directory and do 'make check'. This will
attempt to compile against each header file individually on C and C++, to make
sure there aren't any hidden include ordering problems. Output looks like this,
the zero indicates a successful test. If a C++ file fails to compile as a C
file, add it to the 'cxxfiles.txt' located in the hdrtst directory. Run this
test with all the uconfig.h variations (see below).

unicode/bidi.h - 0 *(0 means no error)*
unicode/chariter.h - 0
unicode/convert.h - 0
markus **Test uconfig.h variations** M C CF-1w

Test ICU completely, and run the header test (above) with:

1.  **none** of the 'UCONFIG_NO_XXX' switches turned on (i.e., the normal case)
2.  **all** of the 'UCONFIG_NO_XXX' switches turned on (set to 1)
3.  For each switch, test once with **just** that one switch on.

(See
[common/unicode/uconfig.h](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/source/common/unicode/uconfig.h)
for more documentation.)
There is a script available which will automatically test ICU in this way on
UNIXes, it lives in:
[tools/release/c/uconfigtest.sh](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/tools/trunk/release/c/uconfigtest.sh).
See docs at top of script for information. markus **Test C++ Namespace Use**
M C CF-1w Verify that ICU builds without enabling the default use of the ICU
namespace. To test on Linux,
./runConfigureICU Linux CXXFLAGS="-DU_USING_ICU_NAMESPACE=0"
make check
Any problems will show up as compilation errors. markus **Test
U_CHARSET_IS_UTF8**
M C CF-1w Verify that ICU builds with default charset hardcoded to UTF-8. To
test on Linux,
./runConfigureICU Linux CPPFLAGS="-DU_CHARSET_IS_UTF8=1"
make check
Any problems will show up as compilation or test errors.
Rather than setting the CPPFLAGS, you can also temporarily add #define
U_CHARSET_IS_UTF8 1 in unicode/utypes.h before it gets its default definition,
or modify the default definition there.
**Test** This works best on a machine that is set to use UTF-8 as its system charset, which is not possible on Windows. michael done
**ICU_USE_THREADS=0** C CF-1w Verify that ICU builds and tests with threading
disabled. To test on Linux,

make check michael done **Update urename.h** M C FF, CF

Update urename.h to catch all possible ICU4C library exports (especially on
non-Windows systems that tend to ignore export qualifiers). See [
icu/source/tools/genren/README](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/source/tools/genren/README).

**Update the pool bundle** C & J CF-1w The locale data resource bundles use a
pool.res bundle for sharing most of their resource table key strings. We should
update the pool bundle once per release, or when we get new data from CLDR, to
capture the changing set of key strings.

1.  Build ICU4C
2.  Temporarily modify the data makefile: s/usePoolBundle/writePoolBundle/
3.  Rebuild the data
4.  Copy $icu4c_out/data/out/build/icudt.../pool.res to
    $icu4c_root/source/data/locales/pool.res
5.  Revert the data makefile change
6.  Rebuild the data (make sure it actually gets rebuilt, e.g., by first
    deleting all of the data/out files)
7.  Run ICU4C tests
8.  Rebuild the ICU4J data .jar files

markus **Test data portability** C CF-1w

Test if the data portability (under common endianness & charset family) is ok.
On the ICU build server, you would use the "Build from source .dat archive"
option. When it's not available, you would do the following:

1.  Build ICU4C on Win32.
2.  Copy the icu/source/data/out/icudt<data_version>l.dat file into
    icu/source/data/in
3.  Delete non-essential directories from icu/source/data.
4.  Package up a clean copy of ICU for a non-Windows machine, like Linux on x86.
5.  Build ICU on the non-Windows machine from the newly created package.
6.  Run all tests on that non-Windows machine.

regardless of a user's default locale and timezone. This test should be run on a
fast machine with several CPU cores. This will take a long time to run. Here are
the steps to run the test.

1.  cd tools/release/c/
2.  ./environmentTest.sh
3.  Wait a while for the tests to finish. The logs will be written in each test
    directory. e.g. icu/source/test/intltest/intltest-\*.txt. A message will be
    printed from each spawned test script when it finishes.
4.  grep the logs for any test failures when the tests are done.

michael **Upgrade LocaleExplorer and other demos/samples to the ICU project
site** C & J GA

Build the icuapps module following the README's. Update code and/or docs as
needed. "Reference" platforms for icuapps are: RedHat Linux and win32. On Linux,
icuapps is built against the "make install "'ed ICU. So, run ICU4C's configure
with --prefix=*/some/where* pointing to where ICU4C should be installed, and
also follow icuapps's README.

Install the new locale explorer and other demos/samples onto the public demo
hosting site.

N/A - - **Update the API Change Report** M C & J CF+1w

**For ICU4C**:

1.  Update the API documentation in all header files (.h file) to have correct

4.  make docs
5.  Folow instructions in [
    tools/release/java/readme.txt](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/tools/trunk/release/java/readme.txt).

**For ICU4J**:

Run the ICU4C API comparison tools (build.xml targets gatherapi, apireport) to
generate new api and report files (build.xml strings will need to change). Check

    *   Changelog: Leave BLANK. This is for a single page of ALL release changes
        (Actually: http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/ fits this fairly
        well.)
    *   License - leave at MIT/X
    *   mailing list: I set this to the main mailing list page.

8.  PREVIEW.
    Very important- Check:
    *   SPELLING
    *   links!!!!! Make sure they go where we want
    *   accuracy - version number is OK?
    Remember that this is an important PR face for ICU4C and ICU4J.
9.  Submit!

That's it. Submissions take some time (<24 hrs) to go on. I guess they check the
accuracy as well- not sure here. (Steven Loomis, 2001-06-14)
