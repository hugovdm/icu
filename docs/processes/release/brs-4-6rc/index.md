done Nov 1 yoshito No tzdata update since Nov 1. Ready for RC2.
- up to date as of Dec. **Make sure the timezone (Olson) data is up to date** C
& J FF, CF, GA

Olson timezone data should be regularly updated in the trunk. If the data is out
of date, follow the instruction described in the
[readme](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/data/trunk/tzdata/readme.txt)
file.

Once the timezone resource file is generated by the process above, the file
should be checked into
[zoneinfo.txt](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/source/data/misc/zoneinfo.txt)
in the trunk.

C- done for rc2 Nov 16 (except checking U_HIDE_ DRAFT_API)
J - done when RC1 was tagged
C - peter
J - yoshito **Update API status comments** C & J FF

**ICU4C**:

1.  Update the API documentation in all header files (.h file) to have correct
    @draft/@stable/@deprecated labels.
2.  Update docmain.h
3.  ./configure
4.  make doc
5.  Follow instructions in
    [readme.txt](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/tools/trunk/release/java/readme.txt)
    to generate API status change report.
6.  Make sure that ICU headers work with U_HIDE_DRAFT_API and other such
    switches.
    1.  Perhaps build with hide-draft then run hdrtest (see instructions
        elsewhere)
7.  Verify that U_DRAFT and U_STABLE match the @draft and @stable tags (same for
    other such pairs declaration macro vs. tag).

**ICU4J**:

Update the API documentation to have correct @draft/@stable/@deprecated labels.
On ICU4J, run
[com.ibm.icu.dev.tool.docs.CheckTags](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu4j/trunk/src/com/ibm/icu/dev/tool/docs/CheckTags.java)(see
file for instructions). This requires a Sun jdk with javadoc available. The tool
will need to change to reflect the release number to search for.

To check the API status changes, run the ant target "apireport" to gerate the
report since the previous official release.

Make sure @provisional is specified along with @draft, and @deprecated with
@internal. For example,

> \* @draft ICU 4.0
> \* @provisional This API might change or be removed in a future release.

> \* @internal
> \* @deprecated This API is ICU internal only.

**Check for ClassID in new class hierarchies** C FF Check that there are no
"poor man's RTTI" in new class hierarchies. See Normalizer2 for an example
declaration and implementation that satisfies the virtual-function override
without adding new ClassID support.
We do need to keep and add "poor man's RTTI" in old classes, and in new classes
extending existing class hierarchies (where parent classes have @stable RTTI
functions). (For example, a new Format subclass.)
One easy way to check for this is to search through the API change report and
look for "UClassID" or similar. J -done
yoshito Need to do this earlier. Also the tool might need to be updated to
capture further API info.
**Compare ICU4J APIs with JDK** J FF-4w

Run the ICU4J versus JDK API comparison tool against the target JDK (anything
that will come out before our next release, basically) with the tool
[com.ibm.icu.dev.tool.docs.ICUJDKCompare](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu4j/trunk/src/com/ibm/icu/dev/tool/docs/ICUJDKCompare.java)
and make sure ICU4J adequately covers the JDK API for the classes we replicate.

GA-1W Add a tag to the CLDR repository that specifies exactly the CLDR data
files and tools that were used to create the ICU data for this ICU release or
milestone. Document the tag name in the ICU Readme file. Verify that ICU data
can be successfully regenerated using the GA ICU code and the tagged CLDR.
If CLDR already has an appropriate tag, just use it.

For ICU 3.6, this is the text of the public beta announcement:

> Subject: ICU 3.6 beta now available
> Dear friends and users of ICU,
> We have a "beta" of the ICU release 3.6 available on our public web sites,

done **Make sure data file versions (for ==data contents==) are properly
assigned** C (data resides in the ICU4C repository) CF-2w

If any of the data files in
[/icu/source/data/](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/source/data/)
directory has changed **MANUALLY**, upgrade the version number accordingly as
well. If the contents of a resource bundle has changed, then increase the
version number (at least the minor version field). The CLDR generated data
should have the correct number.

**Note** from Markus (20090514, ICU 4.2 timeframe): Most data files
automatically get their version numbers set by the LDML2ICUConverter, from CLDR
version numbers. It is not clear what, if anything, needs to be done for this
task.

Add list of what needs updating

done nov01 markus collation: Stuart updated the formatVersion from 2.3 to 3.0
**Make sure data file==format== versions are updated**
C (generator and runtime code) & J (runtime code)
CF-2w

If the format of a binary data file has changed, upgrade the format version in
the UDataInfo header for that file. Better: Change the format version
immediately when the format is changed. The change must be made in both the
producer/generator and consumer/runtime code.

It is desirable to maintain backward compatibility, but sometimes impractical.
Update the major version number for incompatible changes. Runtime code should
permit higher minor version numbers for supported major versions.

We rarely use the third and fourth version number fields, except for UTrie
(version 1) parameters that don't really change.

done Nov 17
michaelow **Scan for Copyright notices** C & J CF-1w

Check source and data files, especially newly contributed ones, to make sure the
proper copyright notice is in place. For example,

> Copyright (c) 2001-2008, International Business Machines Corporation
> and others. All rights reserved.

Scan the source code to make sure that every file that was touched recently has
the current year in the copyright statement. See the [ICU Copyright
Scanner](../../copyright-scan.md) page and follow the link to the scripts and
the readme.

Scan the source code to include third-party company names in copyright notices
if necessary.

Scan for text files that do not contain the word "Copyright": find_textfiles
-nosvn -novc | xargs grep -i -L Copyright (See the find_textfiles Perl script
attached to this page.)

Make sure that you use `(c)`, not Â©, because non-ASCII characters in source code
can break the build!
(See [ICU's check-in policy](http://icu-project.org/copyright-scan.html) for
more details.)

\[Source\] - \[Organize Imports\] which resolve all wildcard imports and sort
the import statements in a consistent order. (Note: You may experience OOM
problem when your run this for projects/folders which contain many files. In
this case, you may need to narrow a selection per iteration.)

r28989 **Verify proper memory allocation functions** C CF-2w

Verify the following for library code (common, i18n, layout, ustdio). The
requirement is for ICU's memory management to be customizable by changing
cmemory.h and the common base class.

*   No raw malloc/free/realloc but their uprv_ versions.
*   All C++ classes must inherit the common base class UObject or UMemory
    *   But not for mixin/interface classes (pure virtual, no data members, no
        constructors) because that would break the single-inheritance model.
    *   Also not for pure-static classes (used for name scoping) declare but
        don't implement a private default constructor to prevent instantiation.
    *   Simple struct-like C++ classes (and structs) that do not have
        constructors, destructors, and virtual methods, need not inherit the
        base class but must then be allocated with uprv_malloc.
*   All simple types (UChar, int32_t, pointers(!), ...) must be allocated with
    uprv_malloc and released with uprv_free.
*   For Testing that this is the case, on Linux
    *   run the Perl script ICUMemCheck.pl. Follow the instructions in the
        script. The script is in in the ICU4C sources at
        icu/tools/memcheck/ICUMemCheck.pl.
*   For testing that this is the case, on Windows:
    *   Don't bother, as of Nov, 2004. Failures appear in many dozens of files
        from the mixin class destructors. Do the check on Linux. But, for
        reference, here are the old instructions.
        *   Make sure that in uobject.h UObject::new and delete are defined by
            default. Currently, this means to grep to see
            thatU_OVERRIDE_CXX_ALLOCATION is defined to 1 (in pwin32.h for
            Windows).
        *   Check the \*.obj's for linkage to the global (non-UObject::)
            operators new/delete; see uobject.cpp for details.
        *   Global new must never be imported. Global delete will be imported
            and used by empty-virtual destructors in interface/mixin classes.
            However, they are not called because implementation classes always
            derive from UMemory. No other functions must use global delete.
        *   There are now (2002-dec-17) definitions in utypes.h for global
            new/delete, with inline implementations that will always crash.
            These global new/delete operators are only defined for code inside
            the ICU4C libraries (but must be there for all of those). See
            Jitterbug 2581.
        *   If a global new/delete is used somewhere, then change the class
            inheritance and/or use uprv_malloc/free until no global new/delete
            are used in the libraries (and the tests still pass...). See the
            User Guide Coding Guidelines for details.

andy, michaelow run late oct, was OK, will run again **Run static code analysis
tools (Purify, Boundary Checker, valgrind...)** C CF-2w Make sure we fixed all
the memory leak problems that were discovered when running these tools.

*   Build ICU with debug information. On Linux,
    runConfigureICU --enable-debug --disable-release Linux
*   Run all of the standard tests under valgrind. For intltest, for example
    cd <where ever>/source/test/intltest
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../lib:../../stubdata:../../tools/ctestfw:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

**Testing external dependencies in header files**:

(on Unixes) Prerequisite: Configure with --prefix
(../trunk/source/runConfigureICU Linux --prefix=/some/temp/folder) and do 'make
install'. Then set the PATH so that the installed icu-config script can be
found. (export PATH=/some/temp/folder==**/bin**==:$PATH)

Then go to the 'icu/source/test/hdrtst' directory and do 'make check'. This will
attempt to compile against each header file individually on C and C++, to make
sure there aren't any hidden include ordering problems. Output looks like this,
the zero indicates a successful test. If a C++ file fails to compile as a C
file, add it to the 'cxxfiles.txt' located in the hdrtst directory. Run this
test with all the uconfig.h variations (see below).

Diff the new one with the previous one; there are typically a few bad #defines
in there.

You are looking to make sure that the defines all are correct exported symbols
and that the Perl script hasn't inadvertently grabbed extraneous text. Each of
the defines should be of the format "uxxxx_NamingConvention". If not then you
need to determine if it's a script issue or a poorly named method.

the comments with orange background. There are some issues in the current ICU
XLIFF tools and the test case below. See the comments in
[ticket#6383](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/6383).
Instructions for verifying the XLIFF conversion tools.

*   Convert icu/source/test/testdata/ra.txt to XLIFF
    genrb -s icu/source/test/testdata -d icu/source/test/testdata/ -x -l en ra.txt

-d icu/source/test/testdata/ overwrite the existing ra.xlf. Specify another
directory.
ra.txt has the top level item "ra", which is supposed to be the content
language. Thus, with -l en, you'll get a warning -
"The top level tag in the resource and language specified are not the same.
Please check the input."
We should use "-l ra" here.

*   Verify that the ra.xlf produced is identical to the one in CVS HEAD (except
    for generation date)
    If you use "-l ra" above, you'll get <file .... source-language = "ra" ....
    />, which is different from ra.xlf in the repository.
    Also, new line codes is broken for imported contents.
*   Convert icu/source/test/testdata/ra.xlf back to ICU format
    java -cp icu4j/classes com.ibm.icu.dev.tool.localeconverter.XLIFF2ICUConverter -d . -t ra ra.xlf
    The option "-t ra" does not work, because ra.xlf does not contain target language data. Use "-c ra" instead.
*   Verify that the ra.txt produced is identical to the one in CVS HEAD (except
    for generation date)
    You cannot expect the generated ra.txt exactly matches the original one
    because of table item re-ordering, new line code changes,
    and explicit resource types (e.g. "ra {" vs. "ra:table {").
*   Go through the steps given in
    <http://icu.sourceforge.net/docs/papers/localize_with_XLIFF_and_ICU.pdf>

each of the reference platforms. A list of them is in
the[readme](http://icu.sanjose.ibm.com/internal/checklist/icu-progs-list.html).
Also see the build system.

Another worthy test: Test suites and demos *from the previous release* should
also compile and run with the libraries of the current release, at least when
certain #defines are set (unless they test APIs that are deprecated and have
been removed since)!

done oct28 markus C: r28947 J: r28948 **Update the pool bundles** C & J CF-1w
The locale data resource bundles use pool.res bundles (one per bundle tree) for
sharing most of their resource table key strings. We should update the pool
bundles once per release, or when we get new data from CLDR, or change the tree
or key structure, to capture the changing set of key strings.

1.  Build ICU4C
2.  Temporarily modify the data makefile: s/usePoolBundle/writePoolBundle/
3.  Rebuild the data
4.  Copy $icu4c_out/data/out/build/icudt.../pool.res to
    $icu4c_root/source/data/locales/pool.res
5.  Copy $icu4c_out/data/out/build/icudt.../curr/pool.res to
    $icu4c_root/source/data/locales/curr/pool.res
7.  Copy all of the pool.res files like this
8.  Revert the data makefile change
9.  Rebuild the data (make sure it actually gets rebuilt, e.g., by first
    deleting all of the data/out files)
10. Run ICU4C tests
11. Rebuild the ICU4J data .jar files

If there are new bundle trees that should use pool.res files, then first modify
the data makefiles (Windows and Linux) to add the new pool.res to the
appropriate file lists and initially add --writePoolBundle which at the end also
needs to be turned into --usePoolBundle.

done Dec 2 pedberg built data on Win x86, built clean make check on MacOSX x86
with that data file and no data sources, no errors **Test data portability** C
CF-1w

Test if the data portability (under common endianness & charset family) is ok.
On the ICU build server, you would use the "Build from source .dat archive"
option. When it's not available, you would do the following:

1.  Build ICU4C on Win32.
2.  Copy the icu/source/data/out/icudt<data_version>l.dat file into
    icu/source/data/in
3.  Delete non-essential directories from icu/source/data.
4.  Package up a clean copy of ICU for a non-Windows machine, like Linux on x86.
5.  Build ICU on the non-Windows machine from the newly created package.
6.  Run all tests on that non-Windows machine.

michaelow **Run the environment tests** C CF-2w

Run
[environmentTest.sh](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/tools/trunk/release/c/environmentTest.sh)
on a Linux machine This test verifies that the ICU test suite will work
regardless of a user's default locale and timezone. This test should be run on a
fast machine with several CPU cores. This will take a long time to run. Here are
the steps to run the test.

1.  cd tools/release/c/
2.  ./environmentTest.sh
3.  Wait a while for the tests to finish. The logs will be written in each test
    directory. e.g. icu/source/test/intltest/intltest-\*.txt. A message will be
    printed from each spawned test script when it finishes.
4.  grep the logs for any test failures when the tests are done.

skip for rc2 **Upgrade LocaleExplorer and other demos/samples to the ICU project
site** C & J GA

Build the icuapps module following the README's. Update code and/or docs as
needed. "Reference" platforms for icuapps are: RedHat Linux and win32. On Linux,
icuapps is built against the "make install "'ed ICU. So, run ICU4C's configure
with --prefix=*/some/where* pointing to where ICU4C should be installed, and
also follow icuapps's README.

Install the new locale explorer and other demos/samples onto the public demo
hosting site.

C - done nov2-4 for rc1; redone Nov 16 for rc2 C - srl
J - yoshito **Update the API Change Report** C & J CF+1w

**For ICU4C**:

1.  Update the API documentation in all header files (.h file) to have correct
    @draft/@stable/@deprecated labels.
2.  Update docmain.h
3.  ./configure
4.  make docs
5.  Folow instructions in
    [tools/release/java/readme.txt](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/tools/trunk/release/java/readme.txt).

**For ICU4J**:

1.  Run ant task "apireport" at <icu4j_root>
2.  Above will produce API change report file
    <icu4j_root>/out/icu4j_compare_xxx_yyy.html
3.  Make sure there are any new doc tag errors are reported. (As of ICU 4.4,
    ArabicShaping constants do not have proper tags - otherwise, clean)
4.  Copy generated report file to <icu4j_root>/APIChangeReport.html and check it
    in.

Once official release version is shipped, we need to keep API signature
information file for next iteration. This is not done for milestone releases,
only after the final official release.

1.  Run ant task "gatherapi" at <icu4j_root>
2.  Above will produce API signature information file
    <icu4j_root>/out/icu4jxx.api2.gz
3.  Copy icu4jxxapi2.gz to <icu4j_root>/tools/build and add it to the repository

**Update the Readme.html for GA** C & J GA-1w

If there are any last second changes. Make sure to document especially items
that affect software that is currently compiled with the previous version of
ICU. Update build/installation instructions as necessary.

GA-0.5w An enhancement release simply needs to have a list of what has been
changed or added recently. A reference release should have much more detailed
descriptions, especially of what API's have changed since the **last reference
release** and migration steps. C source & docs done Dec 2
C source & docs - pedberg
C binaries - IBM
J - pedberg, requires Java 6 C source & docs done Nov 19 for rc2, Dec 2 for
final
**Upload Release Source/Binaries**J done Nov 19 for rc2
**(source only for C, or is that just for milesontes?)** C&J GA-0.49w Download
Directories are located at, for example,
**icu-project.org:/home/htdocs/ex/files/icu4c/4.4.2**
corresponding to <http://download.icu-project.org/ex/files/icu4c/4.4.2/>
Look at previous releases for an example.
**Java Source/Bin:** '`ant release`' from the top level checkout of ICU4J will
create the '`release/`' subdirectory containing all jars.
**C source: \[SRL: This section is currently broken. \] From a Unix platform:**
**~~Note that it is important that the C source contain pre-built data.~~**

1.  **Check out the ICU release with svn. These instructions will not package up
    local changes, because the pristine source will be re-exported from svn.**
2.  **Configure and build ICU**
3.  **Run "make dist"**
4.  **icu4c-docs-\*.zip, icu4c-src-\*.zip, and icu4c-src-\*.tgz will be
    created.**
5.  **Rename the files as appropriate and upload.**

**C binary:**
**Currently, the IBM ICU Build System is the only source of C binary builds. Unix builds are just the output of 'make install', Windows builds are the rough equivalent.**
**MD5 files:**
**Create three different '.md5' files for icu4j (all files), icu4c (source) and icu4c (binaries).**
**Use cfv: <http://cfv.sf.net> like this to create a .md5 file:**
**`cfv -t md5 -C -f icu-â¦â¦-src.md5 somefile.zip somefile.tgz` â¦**
To verify, just run "`cfv -f icu-â¦â¦-src.md5`" and it will verify that the md5
file contains hashes for all referenced files.
done Dec 2 pedberg not for rc2 **Check the ICU public site for the new release**

Make sure that, aside from download pages, homepages, news items, feature lists
and feature comparisons, etc. are updated. Upload the new API references. Update
the User Guide.

**For freshmeat.net**

1.  <http://www.freshmeat.net/>
2.  Login under the correct account.
3.  I usually search for: icu unicode
4.  Click on the project returned
5.  Under the 'project' drop down, choose 'Add release'
6.  We have (thankfully) only one branch of development- choose Default
7.  Release info
    *   release focus: Choose the one which best fits
    *   Version
    *   Changes: be VERY brief, and include links if needed.
        Please read the other ICU4C/ICU4J updates to get an idea for how we are
        wording these. DO NOT use bulleted lists. DO use short 'sentences'.
        Remember they can go to the release list and/or bug DB for the full
        scoop!
        Put the URL to the 'release notes' (i.e.
        http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/(version)/ ) in the changes
        list.
    *   tar/gz, zip: Put the FULL URLs to the actual files, here
    *   Changelog: Leave BLANK. This is for a single page of ALL release changes
        (Actually: http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/ fits this fairly
        well.)
    *   License - leave at MIT/X
    *   mailing list: I set this to the main mailing list page.
        (http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/archives/)
    Click 'go on..'
8.  PREVIEW.
    Very important- Check:
    *   SPELLING
    *   links!!!!! Make sure they go where we want
    *   accuracy - version number is OK?
    Remember that this is an important PR face for ICU4C and ICU4J.
9.  Submit!

That's it. Submissions take some time (<24 hrs) to go on. I guess they check the
accuracy as well- not sure here. (Steven Loomis, 2001-06-14)
