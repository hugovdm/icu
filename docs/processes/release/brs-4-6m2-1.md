yoshito Updated to 2010m on Sep 27.
**Make sure the timezone (Olson) data is up to date** M C & J FF, CF, GA

Olson timezone data should be regularly updated in the trunk. If the data is out
of date, follow the instruction described in the [
readme](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/data/trunk/tzdata/readme.txt)
file.

Once the timezone resource file is generated by the process above, the file
should be checked into [
zoneinfo.txt](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/source/data/misc/zoneinfo.txt)
in the trunk.

SKIP **Update API status comments** C & J FF

**ICU4C**

1.  Update the API documentation in all header files (.h file) to have correct
    @draft/@stable/@deprecated labels.
2.  Update docmain.h
3.  ./configure
4.  make docs
5.  Follow instructions in [
    readme.txt](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/tools/trunk/release/java/readme.txt)
    to generate API status change report.
6.  Make sure that ICU headers work with U_HIDE_DRAFT_API and other such
    switches.
7.  Verify that U_DRAFT and U_STABLE match the @draft and @stable tags (same for
    other such pairs declaration macro vs. tag).

**ICU4J**:

Update the API documentation to have correct @draft/@stable/@deprecated labels.
On ICU4J, run [
com.ibm.icu.dev.tool.docs.CheckTags](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu4j/trunk/src/com/ibm/icu/dev/tool/docs/CheckTags.java)
(see file for instructions). This requires a Sun jdk with javadoc available. The
tool will need to change to reflect the release number to search for.

To check the API status changes, run the ant target "apireport" to gerate the
report since the previous official release.

Make sure @provisional is specified along with @draft, and @deprecated with
@internal. For example,

> \* @draft ICU 4.0
> \* @provisional This API might change or be removed in a future release.

> \* @internal
> \* @deprecated This API is ICU internal only.

skippeed markus didn't get to it for M2, will do before release **Check for
ClassID in new class hierarchies** M C FF Check that there are no "poor man's
RTTI" in new class hierarchies. See Normalizer2 for an example declaration and
implementation that satisfies the virtual-function override without adding new
ClassID support.
We do need to keep and add "poor man's RTTI" in old classes, and in new classes
extending existing class hierarchies (where parent classes have @stable RTTI
functions). (For example, a new Format subclass.)
One easy way to check for this is to search through the API change report and
look for "UClassID" or similar. SKIP **Compare ICU4J APIs with JDK** J FF-4w

Run the ICU4J versus JDK API comparison tool against the target JDK (anything
that will come out before our next release, basically) with the tool [
com.ibm.icu.dev.tool.docs.ICUJDKCompare](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu4j/trunk/src/com/ibm/icu/dev/tool/docs/ICUJDKCompare.java)
and make sure ICU4J adequately covers the JDK API for the classes we replicate.

SKIP **Make sure data file versions (for ==data contents==) are properly
assigned** C (data resides in the ICU4C repository) CF-2w

If any of the data files in [
/icu/source/data/](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/source/data/)
directory has changed **MANUALLY**, upgrade the version number accordingly as
well. If the contents of a resource bundle has changed, then increase the
version number (at least the minor version field). The CLDR generated data
should have the correct number.

**Note** from Markus (20090514, ICU 4.2 timeframe): Most data files
automatically get their version numbers set by the LDML2ICUConverter, from CLDR
version numbers. It is not clear what, if anything, needs to be done for this
task.

skipped markus didn't get to it for M2, will do before release **Make sure data
file ==format== versions are updated**
M C (generator and runtime code) & J (runtime code)
CF-2w

If the format of a binary data file has changed, upgrade the format version in
the UDataInfo header for that file. Better: Change the format version
immediately when the format is changed. The change must be made in both the
producer/generator and consumer/runtime code.

It is desirable to maintain backward compatibility, but sometimes impractical.
Update the major version number for incompatible changes. Runtime code should
permit higher minor version numbers for supported major versions.

We rarely use the third and fourth version number fields, except for UTrie
(version 1) parameters that don't really change.

SKIP **Scan for Copyright notices** C & J CF-1w

Check source and data files, especially newly contributed ones, to make sure the
proper copyright notice is in place. For example,

> Copyright (c) 2001-2008, International Business Machines Corporation
> and others. All rights reserved.

Scan the source code to make sure that every file that was touched recently has
the current year in the copyright statement. See the [ICU Copyright
Scanner](../copyright-scan.md) page and follow the link to the scripts and the
readme.

Scan the source code to include third-party company names in copyright notices
if necessary.

Scan for text files that do not contain the word "Copyright": find_textfiles
-nosvn -novc | xargs grep -i -L Copyright (See the find_textfiles Perl script
attached to this page.)

Make sure that you use `(c)`, not Â©, because non-ASCII characters in source code
can break the build!
(See [ICU's check-in policy](http://icu-project.org/copyright-scan.html) for
more details.)

SKIP **Update license files** C & J CF-1w

Check ICU, Unicode and other license terms. Make sure these files are up to
date. The Unicode data and software license term is updated anually (usually
year number only).

**Clean up import statements**
M
J
CF
Eclipse IDE provides a feature which allow you to organize import statements for
multiple files. Right click on projects/source folders/files, you can select
\[Source\] - \[Organize Imports\] which resolve all wildcard imports and sort
the import statements in a consistent order. (Note: You may experience OOM
problem when your run this for projects/folders which contain many files. In
this case, you may need to narrow a selection per iteration.)
Done andy **Verify proper memory allocation functions**
C CF-2w

Verify the following for library code (common, i18n, layout, ustdio). The
requirement is for ICU's memory management to be customizable by changing
cmemory.h and the common base class.

*   No raw malloc/free/realloc but their uprv_ versions.
*   All C++ classes must inherit the common base class UObject or UMemory
    *   But not for mixin/interface classes (pure virtual, no data members, no
        constructors) because that would break the single-inheritance model.
    *   Also not for pure-static classes (used for name scoping) declare but
        don't implement a private default constructor to prevent instantiation.
    *   Simple struct-like C++ classes (and structs) that do not have
        constructors, destructors, and virtual methods, need not inherit the
        base class but must then be allocated with uprv_malloc.
*   All simple types (UChar, int32_t, pointers(!), ...) must be allocated with
    uprv_malloc and released with uprv_free.
*   For Testing that this is the case, on Linux
    *   run the Perl script ICUMemCheck.pl. Follow the instructions in the
        script. The script is in in the ICU4C sources at
        icu/tools/memcheck/ICUMemCheck.pl.
*   For testing that this is the case, on Windows:
    *   Don't bother, as of Nov, 2004. Failures appear in many dozens of files
        from the mixin class destructors. Do the check on Linux. But, for
        reference, here are the old instructions.
        *   Make sure that in uobject.h UObject::new and delete are defined by
            default. Currently, this means to grep to see that
            U_OVERRIDE_CXX_ALLOCATION is defined to 1 (in pwin32.h for Windows).
        *   Check the \*.obj's for linkage to the global (non-UObject::)
            operators new/delete; see uobject.cpp for details.
        *   Global new must never be imported. Global delete will be imported
            and used by empty-virtual destructors in interface/mixin classes.
            However, they are not called because implementation classes always
            derive from UMemory. No other functions must use global delete.
        *   There are now (2002-dec-17) definitions in utypes.h for global
            new/delete, with inline implementations that will always crash.
            These global new/delete operators are only defined for code inside
            the ICU4C libraries (but must be there for all of those). See
            Jitterbug 2581.
        *   If a global new/delete is used somewhere, then change the class
            inheritance and/or use uprv_malloc/free until no global new/delete
            are used in the libraries (and the tests still pass...). See the
            User Guide Coding Guidelines for details.

andy - valgrind A few problems remain. Ticket 7983
**Run static code analysis tools (Purify, Boundary Checker, valgrind...)** M C
CF-2w Make sure we fixed all the memory leak problems that were discovered when
running these tools.

*   Build ICU with debug information. On Linux,
    runConfigureICU --enable-debug --disable-release Linux
*   Run all of the standard tests under valgrind. For intltest, for example
    cd <where ever>/source/test/intltest
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../lib:../../stubdata:../../tools/ctestfw:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    valgrind ./intltest
    You can grab the command line for running the tests from the output from

done michael **Try running tests without any ICU data** M C & J CF-1w

**ICU4C**:

ICU data should be removed, so that tests cannot access it. Both cintltst and
intltest should be run with -w option and they should not crash. Every crash
should be investigated and fixed.

**Testing external dependencies in header files**:

(on Unixes) Prerequisite: Configure with --prefix
(../trunk/source/runConfigureICU Linux --prefix=/some/temp/folder) and do 'make
install'. Then set the PATH so that the installed icu-config script can be
found. (export PATH=/some/temp/folder==**/bin**==:$PATH)

Then go to the 'icu/source/test/hdrtst' directory and do 'make check'. This will
attempt to compile against each header file individually on C and C++, to make
sure there aren't any hidden include ordering problems. Output looks like this,
the zero indicates a successful test. If a C++ file fails to compile as a C
file, add it to the 'cxxfiles.txt' located in the hdrtst directory. Run this
test with all the uconfig.h variations (see below).

unicode/bidi.h - 0 *(0 means no error)*

Test ICU completely, and run the header test (above) with:

1.  **none** of the 'UCONFIG_NO_XXX' switches turned on (i.e., the normal case)
2.  **all** of the 'UCONFIG_NO_XXX' switches turned on (set to 1)
3.  For each switch, test once with **just** that one switch on.

(See

Any problems will show up as compilation or test errors.
Rather than setting the CPPFLAGS, you can also temporarily add #define
U_CHARSET_IS_UTF8 1 in unicode/utypes.h before it gets its default definition,
or modify the default definition there.

Update urename.h to catch all possible ICU4C library exports (especially on
non-Windows systems that tend to ignore export qualifiers). See [
icu/source/tools/genren/README](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/source/tools/genren/README).

SKIP **Verify XLIFF conversion** J (The tool resides in the ICU4J repository) CF
**Note:** The following instruction does not work. Please read the comments with
orange background. There are some issues in the current ICU XLIFF tools and the
test case below. See the comments in
[ticket#6383](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/6383).
Instructions for verifying the XLIFF conversion tools.

*   Convert icu/source/test/testdata/ra.txt to XLIFF
    genrb -s icu/source/test/testdata -d icu/source/test/testdata/ -x -l en ra.txt

-d icu/source/test/testdata/ overwrite the existing ra.xlf. Specify another
directory.
ra.txt has the top level item "ra", which is supposed to be the content
language. Thus, with -l en, you'll get a warning -
"The top level tag in the resource and language specified are not the same.
Please check the input."
We should use "-l ra" here.

*   Verify that the ra.xlf produced is identical to the one in CVS HEAD (except
    for generation date)
    If you use "-l ra" above, you'll get <file .... source-language = "ra" ....
    />, which is different from ra.xlf in the repository.
    Also, new line codes is broken for imported contents.
*   Convert icu/source/test/testdata/ra.xlf back to ICU format
    java -cp icu4j/classes com.ibm.icu.dev.tool.localeconverter.XLIFF2ICUConverter -d . -t ra ra.xlf
    The option "-t ra" does not work, because ra.xlf does not contain target language data. Use "-c ra" instead.
*   Verify that the ra.txt produced is identical to the one in CVS HEAD (except
    for generation date)
    You cannot expect the generated ra.txt exactly matches the original one
    because of table item re-ordering, new line code changes,
    and explicit resource types (e.g. "ra {" vs. "ra:table {").
*   Go through the steps given in [
    http://icu.sourceforge.net/docs/papers/localize_with_XLIFF_and_ICU.pdf](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Ficu.sourceforge.net%2Fdocs%2Fpapers%2Flocalize_with_XLIFF_and_ICU.pdf)

SKIP **Test sample and demo programs** C & J FF-1w, CF

Build and run all of the sample and demo apps that are included with ICU, on
each of the reference platforms. A list of them is in the [
readme](http://icu.sanjose.ibm.com/internal/checklist/icu-progs-list.html). Also
see the build system.

Another worthy test: Test suites and demos *from the previous release* should
also compile and run with the libraries of the current release, at least when
certain #defines are set (unless they test APIs that are deprecated and have
been removed since)!

skipped markus didn't get to it for M2, will do before release **Update the pool
bundles** C & J CF-1w The locale data resource bundles use pool.res bundles (one
per bundle tree) for sharing most of their resource table key strings. We should
update the pool bundles once per release, or when we get new data from CLDR, or
change the tree or key structure, to capture the changing set of key strings.

1.  Build ICU4C
2.  Temporarily modify the data makefile: s/usePoolBundle/writePoolBundle/
3.  Rebuild the data
4.  Copy $icu4c_out/data/out/build/icudt.../pool.res to
    $icu4c_root/source/data/locales/pool.res
5.  Copy $icu4c_out/data/out/build/icudt.../curr/pool.res to
    $icu4c_root/source/data/locales/curr/pool.res
7.  Copy all of the pool.res files like this
8.  Revert the data makefile change
9.  Rebuild the data (make sure it actually gets rebuilt, e.g., by first
    deleting all of the data/out files)
10. Run ICU4C tests
11. Rebuild the ICU4J data .jar files

If there are new bundle trees that should use pool.res files, then first modify
the data makefiles (Windows and Linux) to add the new pool.res to the
appropriate file lists and initially add --writePoolBundle which at the end also
needs to be turned into --usePoolBundle.

SKIP **Test data portability** C CF-1w

Test if the data portability (under common endianness & charset family) is ok.
On the ICU build server, you would use the "Build from source .dat archive"
option. When it's not available, you would do the following:

1.  Build ICU4C on Win32.
2.  Copy the icu/source/data/out/icudt<data_version>l.dat file into
    icu/source/data/in
3.  Delete non-essential directories from icu/source/data.
4.  Package up a clean copy of ICU for a non-Windows machine, like Linux on x86.
5.  Build ICU on the non-Windows machine from the newly created package.
6.  Run all tests on that non-Windows machine.

SKIP **Run the environment tests** C CF-2w

Run [
environmentTest.sh](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/tools/trunk/release/c/environmentTest.sh)
on a Linux machine This test verifies that the ICU test suite will work
regardless of a user's default locale and timezone. This test should be run on a
fast machine with several CPU cores. This will take a long time to run. Here are
the steps to run the test.

1.  cd tools/release/c/
2.  ./environmentTest.sh
3.  Wait a while for the tests to finish. The logs will be written in each test
    directory. e.g. icu/source/test/intltest/intltest-\*.txt. A message will be
    printed from each spawned test script when it finishes.
4.  grep the logs for any test failures when the tests are done.

SKIP **Upgrade LocaleExplorer and other demos/samples to the ICU project site**
C & J GA

Build the icuapps module following the README's. Update code and/or docs as
needed. "Reference" platforms for icuapps are: RedHat Linux and win32. On Linux,
icuapps is built against the "make install "'ed ICU. So, run ICU4C's configure

J - yoshito **Update the API Change Report** M C & J CF+1w

**For ICU4C**:

1.  Update the API documentation in all header files (.h file) to have correct
    @draft/@stable/@deprecated labels.
2.  Update docmain.h
3.  ./configure
4.  make docs
5.  Folow instructions in [
    tools/release/java/readme.txt](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/tools/trunk/release/java/readme.txt).

**For ICU4J**:

Run the ICU4C API comparison tools (build.xml targets gatherapi, apireport) to
generate new api and report files (build.xml strings will need to change). Check
in the API file. Rename the report file to ${root}/APIChangeReport.html and
replace the existing one and check it in. Make sure the readme.html file links
to it (no change should be required).

DONE stuart **Update the Readme.html for GA** M C & J GA-1w

If there are any last second changes. Make sure to document especially items
that affect software that is currently compiled with the previous version of
ICU. Update build/installation instructions as necessary.

DONE 2010-09-27 stuart, yoshito
**Create ICU download page** M GA-0.5w An enhancement release simply needs to
have a list of what has been changed or added recently. A reference release
should have much more detailed descriptions, especially of what API's have
changed since the **last reference release** and migration steps. done C -
pedberg, srl
J - yoshito **Upload Release Source / Binaries** M (source only for C?) C & J
GA-0.49w See parent doc for details DONE stuart **Check the ICU public site for
the new release** M GA

**For freshmeat.net**

1.  <http://www.freshmeat.net/>
2.  Login under the correct account.
3.  I usually search for: icu unicode
4.  Click on the project returned
5.  Under the 'project' drop down, choose 'Add release'
6.  We have (thankfully) only one branch of development- choose Default
7.  Release info
    *   release focus: Choose the one which best fits
    *   Version
    *   Changes: be VERY brief, and include links if needed.
        Please read the other ICU4C/ICU4J updates to get an idea for how we are
        wording these. DO NOT use bulleted lists. DO use short 'sentences'.
        Remember they can go to the release list and/or bug DB for the full
        scoop!
        Put the URL to the 'release notes' (i.e.
        http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/(version)/ ) in the changes
        list.
    *   tar/gz, zip: Put the FULL URLs to the actual files, here
    *   Changelog: Leave BLANK. This is for a single page of ALL release changes
        (Actually: http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/ fits this fairly
        well.)
    *   License - leave at MIT/X
    *   mailing list: I set this to the main mailing list page.
        (http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/archives/)
    Click 'go on..'
8.  PREVIEW.
    Very important- Check:
    *   SPELLING
    *   links!!!!! Make sure they go where we want
    *   accuracy - version number is OK?
    Remember that this is an important PR face for ICU4C and ICU4J.
9.  Submit!

That's it. Submissions take some time (<24 hrs) to go on. I guess they check the
accuracy as well- not sure here. (Steven Loomis, 2001-06-14)
