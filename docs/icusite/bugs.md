# Submitting ICU Bugs and Feature Requests

**Note:** ICU uses [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/) locale data. Please submit
feedback on locale data [there](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/bug-reports).

If you would like to submit an ICU bug report or feature request, or search the
ICU bug database, please visit the following link:

*   **[ICU JIRA page](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/)**
*   Note: You need to have a Jira account for submitting a ticket or commenting
    on one.
*   Click the + icon on the left edge to submit a new ticket.
*   Click the üîç icon on the left edge to search for existing tickets.

For patches, please submit both an ICU Jira ticket and an [ICU
GitHub](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu) pull request. The pull request text
should start with "ICU-<Jira ticket number> ".

If you are encountering a build problem, encountering an API usage problem, or
you have a question about ICU, you will usually get a faster response by joining
our [icu-support mailing list](contacts.md) and asking there.

## Finding previous bugs

As of July 1, 2018, all tickets from the previous (ICU trac) ticket tracking
system have been converted over to issues on the [ICU
JIRA](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/projects/ICU/summary) page. Due to
privacy concerns, email addresses of all tickets filed previously were not
carried over. If you want to look for your previous tickets, perhaps filed under
the email address ‚Äú**myname**@example.com‚Äù you can use a URL like this:

*   ==https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=tracReporter%20~%20**myname**==
    (but replace ‚Äú**myname**‚Äù with the part of your email address before the @
    sign.)

## Ticket Lifecycle

*   Information about the ICU ticket process is on the [ticket
    lifecycle](processes/ticket-lifecycle.md) page.

### ~~Excel Spreadsheet View~~

~~An Excel spreadsheet view of the existing Trac Tickets can be found in
[traclist.xls](http://icu-project.org/repository/traclist.xls). *Control-u* will
update from the Trac database while in Excel.~~

~~For OpenOffice, because of the use of macros, the above Excel spread sheet will not work. The actual data, as tab-delimited text, comes from this URL: <http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/report/12?format=tab>~~
~~It can be inserted into an OO spreadsheet using the Insert->Sheet From File menu, and entering the URL.~~
