## Former ICU Project Management Committee

Until 2016-May-18, ICU was a project under IBM stewardship.

The Project Management Committee (PMC) was formed in October 1999 and was
responsible for the strategic direction and success of the ICU Project. This
governing body was expected to ensure the project's welfare and guide its
overall direction. The PMC may not necessarily participate in the day-to-day
coding but is involved in the overall development plans, the alleviation of any
bottlenecks, the resolution of conflicts, and the overall technical success of
the project.

### Membership

There is no term limit for members. PMC members may resign at any time. Any
member may be removed from the PMC by a 3/4 vote of the PMC.

New members may be elected to the PMC. In order to be elected, a person must be
nominated by a PMC Member. Once nominated, all of the PMC will vote and those
receiving a 3/4 positive vote will become a member.
