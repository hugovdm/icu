# getOffset

TBD
Yoshito told Markus on 2007-oct-11 that, internally for ICU 3.8.1, he needed a
version of TimeZone::getOffset() enhanced for supporting ambiguous time at
transitions; "it looks this API is required for making date format parsing
properly". He said that he would start work on it.
Status? Available internally? Or even publicly?
