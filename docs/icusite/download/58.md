# Download ICU 58

[TOC]

ICU is the [premier library for software
internationalization](http://site.icu-project.org/#TOC-What-is-ICU-), used by a
[wide array of companies and organizations](../home/index.md).

## Release Overview

**This is the first release of ICU after the project [joined the Unicode®
Consortium](http://blog.unicode.org/2016/05/icu-joins-unicode-consortium.html).**
The license changed to the [Unicode
license](http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html#License) (which is similar to the
ICU 1.8.1-57 license).

This is the last ICU4C release that works on Windows XP and Windows Vista.

ICU 58 provides full support for the recent Unicode 9.0 release with 7,500 new
characters and many property improvements. It covers the Unicode 9.0 emoji
characters — plus the latest draft version of Emoji 4.0 — for a total of 2,444
emoji characters and sequences, including the new ZWJ sequences for gendered
professions; ICU word & line breaking is updated for Emoji 4.0. ICU 58
incorporates the latest version 30 of Unicode CLDR locale data with a
significant increase in data coverage.

There are a number of new APIs, including ones for measurement system unit
display names (such as “acre” or “Hektar” in 80 languages), and improvements in
performance and robustness. For Java, the unit tests are converted to JUnit, for
easier and faster integration into test suites.

For more details, including migration issues, see below.

Please use the [icu-support mailing list](../contacts.md) and/or [ICU
Trac](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/newticket) for error reports.

## Common Changes

*   CLDR 30.0.2: For details of the many changes in CLDR, see [CLDR
    30](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-30). Some things to note:
    *   For some combinations of numbering system (arab, arabext, latn) and/or
        locale (ar, fa, he), there were changes to the bidirectional control
        characters used with certain symbols (percent, minus, plus), and changes
        to number patterns (currency and/or percent, including addition of
        bidirectional control characters in some cases).
    *   New in this release, the bidirectional controls used for such purposes
        include U+061C ARABIC LETTER MARK (ALM), which requires use of the
        bidirectional algorithm from Unicode 6.3 or later.
    *   The time separator for Norwegian locales (nb, nn) was changed to be ':'
        throughout.
*   [Unicode
    9.0](http://blog.unicode.org/2016/06/announcing-unicode-standard-version-90.html):
    Version 9.0 adds exactly 7,500 characters, for a total of 128,172
    characters. These additions include six new scripts, 19 symbols for the new
    4K TV standard, and 72 new emoji characters.
*   [Draft Emoji 4.0
    data](http://blog.unicode.org/2016/08/proposed-update-utr-51-unicode-emoji.html)
    *   Emoji updates for word & line breaking.
        (#[12664](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/12664) & Unicode 9
        update #[12526](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/12526))
*   UBiDiTransform/BidiTransform API for convenient transformation of text
    between different Bidi layouts.
    (#[11679](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/11679))
*   MeasureFormat API for measurement unit display names.
    (#[12029](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/12029))
*   Most COUNT and LIMIT enum constants have been deprecated.
    (#[12420](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/12420))
*   SpoofChecker: Handling of "whole script confusables" has been removed from
    ICU, in accordance with its removal from [UTS
    #39](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/) Version 9.0.0 and the removal of
    the corresponding Unicode data file.
    (#[12549](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/12549))
*   Greek uppercasing ("el" locale ID) removes most diacritics.
    (#[5456](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/5456))
*   More robust locale data loading across ICU implementation code.
*   Reduced heap memory usage in DateTimePatternGenerator.
    (#[11782](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/11782))

## ICU4C Specific Changes

*   The layout engine code has been removed; the ParagraphLayout is not
    deprecated and remains (and must now be built on top of HarfBuzz). See
    <http://userguide.icu-project.org/layoutengine>
    (#[12708](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/12708))
*   Windows: Supports & requires Visual Studio 2015.

## ICU4J Specific Changes

*   DecimalFormat & DecimalFormatSymbols store & support String values for
    supplementary-character digits and strings for symbols.
    (#[10368](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/10368))
*   LocaleDisplayNames with optional no-substitute handling (null result rather
    than code) via DisplayContext.
    (#[12700](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/12700))
*   Unit tests are now based on JUnit 4.
    (#[10152](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/10152))
*   Filtered Break engine (Sentence Break Suppressions)
    *   The code is now at parity with C, although the APIs themselves remain in
        the tech preview state.
    *   Sentence Break Suppressions may now be chosen by opening a
        `BreakIterator` with a locale ID such as `en@ss=standard` (in BCP47:
        `en-u-ss-standard` ) as with C

## Known Issues

*   C: There are known issues building on IBM z/OS, please see ticket
    #[12766](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/12766)
*   C: There are known issues building the samples, please see ticket
    #[12793](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/12793)
*   C: ucol_getKeywordValuesForLocale() and
    Collator::getKeywordValuesForLocale() return enumerations that are not
    already reset for iteration. (Regression in ICU 58,
    #[12827](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/12827) &
    #[12814](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/12814))
*   C: There are known issues building on Solaris Studio 12.5, please see ticket
    #[12893](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/12893)

## Migration Issues

*   Windows requires Visual Studio 2015, or else use cygwin or similar to build.
*   Number formatting may produce text using U+061C ARABIC LETTER MARK (ALM),
    which requires use of the bidirectional algorithm from Unicode 6.3 or later.
