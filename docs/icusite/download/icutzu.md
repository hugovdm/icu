# ICU Time Zone Update Utility (ICUTZU)

### Introduction

ICU4J Time Zone Update Utility (ICUTZU) is a utility that supplies ICU4J jar
files with the latest time zone information and daylight savings time changeover
dates.

The time zone data is stored in zoneinfo.res files which are generated by the
ICU team using the [Time Zone Database](http://www.iana.org/time-zones). Every
version of the time zone data corresponds directly to a version of the time zone
database. For example "2006a" refers to the first refresh of the time zone
database in 2006.

ICUTZU works by searching the file system for ICU4J jar files containing old
time zone data, checking online for the newest time zone data and updating the
ICU4J jar files accordingly. The user can choose to update from a copy of the
time zone data that comes bundled with ICUTZU or from an online copy on the ICU
servers.

If you would like more information on using ICUTZU, please view the [ICUTZU
documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/unicode-org/icu-data/blob/master/tzdata/tzu/readme.html).
