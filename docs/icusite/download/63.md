# Download ICU 63

[TOC]

ICU is the [premier library for software
internationalization](http://site.icu-project.org/#TOC-What-is-ICU-), used by a
[wide array of companies and organizations](../home/index.md).

## Release Overview

ICU 63 updates to CLDR 34 locale data with many additions and corrections, and
some new languages. ICU adds API for number and currency ==*range*== formatting,
and API for additional Unicode properties and for constructing custom
properties. CLDR and ICU include data for testing readiness for the upcoming
Japanese calendar era.

For more details, including migration issues, see below.

Please use the [icu-support mailing list](../contacts.md) and/or [find/submit
error reports](../bugs.md).

    ([#7270](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-7270))

## ICU4C Specific Changes

*   C++ Locale class
    *   Additional functions forLanguageTag()/toLanguageTag(), and functions
        that are easier and safer to use by using StringPiece and ByteSink
        rather than raw buffers.
        ([#13417](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13417))
    *   Move semantics.
        ([#13645](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13645))
*   ICU4C: Various Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issues have been fixed. ([ticket
    query](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=status%20%3D%20Done%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%2063.1%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20out-of-memory))
*   The **icu-config** tool has been deprecated. You can use the
    `--disable-icu-config` option to disable icu-config from being installed.
    Alternately, you can use `--enable-icu-config` to enable icu-config. In the
    future, icu-config will be disabled by default.
    ([#62845](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-10464?focusedCommentId=62845&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-62845))

## ICU4J Specific Changes

*   Requires Java 7, up from Java 6.
    ([#13413](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13413))

## Known Issues

### Common Issues

*   NaN parse failures with currency formatter
    ([#20211](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20211))
*   UnicodeSet("\[:intprop=value:\]") performance regression when using a
    property for the first time. See
    [#20250](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20250) for details &
    fix.

### ICU4C

*   ICU4C requires C++11 support. Some platforms (such as IBM AIX, IBM z and
    Solaris) may no longer be able to build ICU until an improved compiler is
    available. See the "ICU4C Platform Support" section below.
*   Build failure with Cygwin: Explicit template instantiation needs to be
    inside the namespace.
    ([#20214](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20214)).
*   ICU4C regression: Creating a DateTimePatternGenerator for an invalid or
    missing locale will return "U_MISSING_RESOURCE_ERROR" instead of falling
    back to root with a warning.
    ([ICU-20558](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20558)).
*   Cygwin unzip will not properly unpack the prebuilt Windows binaries
    ([#20567](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20567), fixed in
    64.2).

### ICU4J

*   ICU4J 63 upgraded to Java 7 and was intended to also support Android API
    level 21, but some code required API level 24. See
    [#20255](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20255) for details &
    fix.
*   When `TimeZone.TIMEZONE_JDK` is set as the time zone type, time zone format
    for Europe/Dublin becomes incorrect ("Irish Standard Timen" and "Greenwich
    Mean Time" are swapped) on the latest Oracle and OpenJDK runtime
    ([#13798](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13798)).

## Migration Issues

1.  The recent [Unicode
    11.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/#Migration) changes may
    require some code/tests to be fixed. Notably:
    1.  Word break now groups white space together.
    2.  Segmentation in general simplifies tests for emoji sequences.
    3.  Casing behaves differently for Georgian, and differently for that than
        for any other script.
2.  The French grouping separator changed from no-break space U+00A0 to narrow
    no-break space U+202F.
3.  The C/C++ code for ListFormatter has been moved ==*up*== from the common
    library to the i18n library, so that it can additionally output
    FieldPosition information. If your application is using this API but not
    already linking with the i18n library, you will need to add that to its
    linker input set. (Related to
    [#13754](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13754))
4.  Warning for Python 3: ICU 64 will require Python 3 for data build. The
    warning will become an error in ICU 64.

## ICU4C Platform Support

*   All: Compiler support for C++11 is required for building the ICU libraries.
    *   GCC: version 4.8 and later has been tested.
*   IBM AIX:
    *   xlC C/C++ does not currently support a sufficient subset of C++11
        (#[13393](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13393))
    *   gcc might work
*   macOS: XCode 8.3 (LLVM clang 8.1.0) has been tested.
*   Solaris
    *   Use [Oracle Developer Studio 12.5 or
        later](https://blogs.oracle.com//solaris/entry/oracle_developer_studio_12_5)
    *   May not be supported.
        (#[13393](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13393))
    *   Unicode issues with some test files
        ([#13096](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13096)) (tests are not
        able to build)
    *   Time zone detection errors
        ([#13097](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13097))
*   Windows:
    *   The minimum supported version is Windows 7. Windows XP and Windows Vista
        are no longer supported.
    *   Building the Visual Studio UWP projects requires [Visual Studio
        2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) with a version of the
        [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads)
        installed.
    *   Note: There have been reports of issues with the optimizer in Visual
        Studio 2017 (for example
        #[13636](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13636)). If you
        run into issues with VS2017 you may wish to use VS2015 as a work-around.
    *   When using "@compat=host", on versions below Windows 10 version 1703, 6
        locales have date and number formatting issues
        ([#13119](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13119)).
    *   The LCID conversion APIs don't round-trip Kurdish (ku) and Central
        Kurdish (ckb) due to Windows not having a ckb locale
        ([#20181](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20181)).
*   Windows using the ICC compiler:
    *   Source File Encoding. The ICC compiler does not recognize the
        [/utf-8](https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-c-compiler/topic/733662)
        option. A work-around is known and reported to succeed.
        ([#13251](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13251))
*   IBM z
    *   xlC C/C++ does not currently support a sufficient subset of C++11
        (#[13393](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13393))
