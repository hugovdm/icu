# Download ICU 61

[TOC]

ICU is the [premier library for software
internationalization](http://site.icu-project.org/#TOC-What-is-ICU-), used by a
[wide array of companies and organizations](../home/index.md).

## Release Overview

ICU 61 upgrades to CLDR 33 locale data, has a new Java implementation for number
and currency parsing, and includes many small API additions, improvements, and
bug fixes.

For more details, including migration issues, see below.

Please use the [icu-support mailing list](../contacts.md) and/or [ICU
Trac](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/newticket) for error reports.

## Version Number

The initial release has library version number 61.1.

If there are maintenance releases, they will be 61.2, 61.3, etc. (During ICU 61
development, the library version number was 61.0.x.)

## Common Changes

*   [CLDR 33](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-33):
    *   Two additional locales (Odia, Assamese) were brought up to Modern
        coverage level.
    *   4 new transforms: fa-fa_FONIPA, ha-ha_NE, nv-nv_FONIPA, vec-vec_FONIPA.
    *   New currency code MRU for Mauritania.
    *   Arabic native vs. ASCII digits: It is now possible to change a single
        data value
        ([locales/ar.txt](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/browser/trunk/icu4c/source/data/locales/ar.txt)
        NumberElements/default → "latn", rebuild ICU data) in order to switch
        Arabic-language (but not Arabic-country-variant) number formatting from
        native digits (٠١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩) to ASCII digits (0123456789) which are more
        widely understood. (ICU
        [#13567](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13567), CLDR
        [#10825](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10825))
    *   Data additions & bug fixes.
*   Many small API additions, improvements, and bug fixes.

## ICU4C Specific Changes

*   Added [Google
    double-conversion](https://github.com/google/double-conversion) library for
    formatting doubles
    ([#11318](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/11318)). This is the
    library used in V8 and a number of other projects for converting doubles to
    decimals. To avoid name collisions, the library is linked internally under
    the ICU namespace as icu::double_conversion. Our copy of double_conversion
    is not intended for public usage.
*   Re-wrote U8_NEXT macros to eliminate all library function calls.
    ([#13467](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13467))

## ICU4J Specific Changes

*   Under-the-hood overhaul of number and currency parsing. See the [design
    doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRGRHf7Ga80UzrPxuqXUq67PR0491I7FFp2Ha7MbJaNy-WVLKWwJS_EMsS-7AraivDVsSAQ1aNyWC-L/pub)
    for a summary of changes; behavior is mostly compatible with previous
    versions, but there are some known differences. Please report issues on
    [#13513](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13513).

## Known Issues

### ICU4C

*   The new number formatting API is not available on AIX, Solaris, or z/OS (see
    #[13393](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13393))
*   See also the "ICU4C Platform Support" section below.
*   Cygwin unzip will not properly unpack the prebuilt Windows binaries
    ([#20567](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20567), fixed in
    64.2).

### ICU4J

*   (none so far)

## Migration Issues

C++ call sites need to qualify ICU types explicitly, for example
`icu::UnicodeString`, or do `using icu::UnicodeString;` where appropriate. If
your code relies on the "using namespace icu;" that used to be in
unicode/uversion.h, then you need to update your code.
([#13460](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13460))

*   This has long been one of the [recommended build
    options](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/trunk/icu4c/readme.html#RecBuild);
    see there for details.

## ICU4C Platform Support

*   All: Compiler support for C++11 is required for building the ICU libraries.
    *   GCC: version 4.8 and later has been tested.
*   AIX: Use [xlC C/C++ for AIX 13.1.3 or
    later](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24041101)
*   macOS: XCode 8.3 (LLVM clang 8.1.0) has been tested.
*   Solaris
    *   Use [Oracle Developer Studio 12.5 or
        later](https://blogs.oracle.com//solaris/entry/oracle_developer_studio_12_5)
    *   Unicode issues with some test files
        ([#13096](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13096)) (tests are not
        able to build)
    *   Time zone detection errors
        ([#13097](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13097))
*   Windows:
    *   The minimum supported version is Windows 7. Windows XP and Windows Vista
        are no longer supported.
    *   Building the Visual Studio UWP projects requires [Visual Studio
        2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) with a version of the
        [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads)
        installed.
    *   Note: There have been reports of issues with the optimizer in Visual
        Studio 2017 (for example
        #[13636](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13636)). If you run
        into issues with VS2017 you may wish to use VS2015 as a work-around.
    *   When using "@compat=host", on versions below Windows 10 version 1703, 6
        locales have date and number formatting issues
        ([#13119](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13119)).
    *   Time zone detection issues on Windows 7 with non-English UI
        ([#13826](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13826)). Fixed in the
        "maint-61" branch.
*   Windows using the ICC compiler:
    *   Source File Encoding. The ICC compiler does not recognize the
        [/utf-8](https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-c-compiler/topic/733662)
        option. A work-around is known and reported to succeed.
        ([#13251](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13251))
*   IBM z
    *   Use [xlC C/C++ for IBM z/OS Version 2 Release 2 or
        later](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27036892)
    *   Known test failures
        ([#13095](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13095))
