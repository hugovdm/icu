development, the library version number was 64.0.x.)

Note: There may be additional commits on the
[maint-64](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/tree/maint/maint-64) branch that
are not included in the prepackaged download files below.

## Common Changes

*   [Unicode
    12](http://blog.unicode.org/2019/03/announcing-unicode-standard-version-120.html):
    554 new characters, including 4 new scripts and 61 new emoji characters.
    *   [Unicode 12.1](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.1.0/): One
        additional character U+32FF SQUARE ERA NAME REIWA
*   [CLDR
    35](http://blog.unicode.org/2019/03/unicode-cldr-version-35-languagelocale.html)
    *   Somali and Javanese data now up to modern level
    *   Cebuano, Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba data now up to basic level
    *   23 additional measurement units
    *   Many data additions and corrections in many other languages
    *   The following language has been added to ICU: Cebuano
    *   This version of ICU does not yet implement the Indic Grapheme Cluster
        improvements from CLDR 35.
    *   [CLDR
        35.1](https://sites.google.com/site/cldr/index/downloads/cldr-35#TOC-V35.1)
        adds support for Reiwa period date formatting.
*   New Japanese calendar era from 2019:
    *   CLDR 35.1 and ICU 64.2: Fully supported
    *   CLDR 35 and ICU 64 (=64.1) include data for testing that can be enabled.
        ([ICU #12973](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-12973), [CLDR
        #10750](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10750))
        *   To enable CLDR new Japanese era placeholder name, set environment
            variable (and Java system property for ICU4J)
            ICU_ENABLE_TENTATIVE_ERA=true (This was added in ICU 63).
        *   Support added for Gannen year numbering (using 元 for the first year
            of an era) in the Japanese locale Japanese-calendar full, long, and
            medium formats. Gannen year support is also automatically added for
            other non-numeric formats (those containing other kanji characters
            such as 年) derived from pattern skeletons unless specifically
            overridden. ([ICU
            #20441](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20441), [CLDR
            #11843](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11843), [CLDR
            #11819](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11819))
        *   We are planning for an ICU 64.2 update in 2019-April which will add
            the new Japanese era with its real name.
*   ICU 64 now uses "rearguard" TZ data. (Recent versions have used "vanguard"
    data with certain overrides.)
    ([ICU-20398](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20398))
*   ICU data filtering: The ICU4C build accepts an optional filter script that
    specifies a subset of the data to be built, with whitelists and blacklists
    for locales and for resource bundle paths.
    ([ICU-10923](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-10923), [design
    doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lt9sHy7VbMLA2KbbEpg-TgNAI8bqtetwM767enWjcUg/edit#heading=h.hxnwor8bbk4u))
    *   See this new documentation page:
        [userguide/icu_data/buildtool.md](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/master/docs/userguide/icu_data/buildtool.md)
*   MessageFormat has new pattern syntax for specifying the style of a date/time
    argument via a locale-independent skeleton rather than a locale-specific
    pattern. ([ICU-9622](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-9622)))
    *   Date/time skeletons use the same "::" prefix as number skeletons.
    *   Example MessageFormat pattern string: `"We close on
        {closing,date,::MMMMd} at {closing,time,::jm}."`
*   Many formatting APIs can now output a new type of result object which is-a
    FormattedValue (Java & C++), or convertible to a UFormattedValue (C).
    *   These combine the result strings with easy iteration over FieldPosition
        metadata.

## ICU4C Specific Changes

*   New C++ class LocaleBuilder for building a Locale from subtags, keywords,
    and extensions.
    ([ICU-20328](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20328))
    *   Parallel to the existing ICU4J ULocale.Builder class.
*   For C++ MeasureUnit instances, there are now additional factory methods that
    return units by value, not by pointer-with-ownership.
    ([ICU-20337](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20337))
*   Various Out-Of-Memory (OOM) handling issues have been fixed. ([ticket
    query](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=status%20%3D%20Done%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%2064.1%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20out-of-memory))

## ICU4J Specific Changes

*   None

## Known Issues

### Common Issues

*   None yet.

### ICU4C

*   ICU4C requires C++11 support. Some platforms (such as IBM AIX, IBM z and
    Solaris) may no longer be able to build ICU until an improved compiler is
    available. See the "ICU4C Platform Support" section below.
*   ICU4C has build errors on Cygwin 3.0.0, please use the previous version of
    Cygwin 2.11.2 as a work-around
    ([ICU-20435](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20435)).
*   ICU4C has known issues compiling with GCC on AIX. These are still being
    investigated ([ICU-3752](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-3752))
*   ICU4C builds on Windows from long folder paths can fail. A work-around is to
    build from a shorter folder path.
    ([ICU-20555](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20555))
*   ICU4C regression introduced in ICU 63: Creating a DateTimePatternGenerator
    for an invalid or missing locale will return "U_MISSING_RESOURCE_ERROR"
    instead of falling back to root with a warning.
    ([ICU-20558](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20558)).
*   ICU4C Data Filtering is broken on Windows Visual Studio builds
    ([ICU-20658](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20658)).
*   ICU4C abort() can be unintentionally called in some cases.
    (IC[ICU-20680](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20680)U)

### ICU4J

*   ICU4J 63 upgraded to Java 7 and was intended to also support Android API
    level 21, but some code required API level 24. See
    [#20255](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20255) for details &
    fix. The fix is included in ICU 64 and on the `maint/maint-63` branch.

## Migration Issues

1.  The locale ID handling for "", "und" and "root" has been made consistent
    across Java, C++, and C. In particular, Locale.getLanguage() will return the
    empty string for each of these now, Locale("und_IN").getName() will be "_IN"
    for consistency, etc. This might require some adjustments.
2.  Locale canonicalization no longer has special mappings for long-obsolete,
    ICU-specific variants (e.g., "PREEURO") and locale IDs (e.g.,
    "de__PHONEBOOK").
    ([ICU-20187](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20187))
    1.  If such locale IDs are still in use, it is best to change them to a
        modern format, for example using currency or collation keywords.
3.  UnicodeString::moveFrom(), LocalPointer::moveFrom() and similar still-@draft
    methods have been removed. They had been added before C++11 was required but
    were then redundant with std::move().
    ([ICU-13081](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13081))
4.  Some number formatter APIs had been renamed in ICU 62, leaving @deprecated
    aliases for the old names; these aliases have now been removed.
    ([ICU-13746](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13746))
5.  There is a new data file ulayout.icu for Unicode text layout properties.
    (These properties were hardcoded in the library code in ICU 63.)
6.  Despite the warning from the ICU 63 build, ICU 64 does not yet require
    Python 3 for building its data files. This requirement has been postponed to
    a future release.

## ICU4C Platform Support

*   All: Compiler support for C++11 is required for building the ICU libraries.
    *   GCC: version 4.8 and later has been tested.
*   IBM AIX:
    *   xlC C/C++ does not currently support a sufficient subset of C++11
        (#[13393](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13393))
    *   gcc might work
*   macOS: XCode 8.3 (LLVM clang 8.1.0) has been tested.
*   Solaris
    *   Use [Oracle Developer Studio 12.5 or
        later](https://blogs.oracle.com//solaris/entry/oracle_developer_studio_12_5)
    *   May not be supported.
        (#[13393](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13393))
    *   Unicode issues with some test files
        ([#13096](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13096)) (tests are not
        able to build)
    *   Time zone detection errors
        ([#13097](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13097))
*   Windows:
    *   The minimum supported version is Windows 7. Windows XP and Windows Vista
        are no longer supported.
    *   Building the Visual Studio UWP projects requires [Visual Studio
        2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) with a version of the
        [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads)
        installed.
    *   Note: There have been reports of issues with the optimizer in Visual
        Studio 2017 (for example
        #[13636](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13636)). If you
        run into issues with VS2017 you may wish to use VS2015 as a work-around.
    *   When using "@compat=host", on versions below Windows 10 version 1703, 6
        locales have date and number formatting issues
        ([#13119](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13119)).
    *   The LCID conversion APIs don't round-trip Kurdish (ku) and Central
        Kurdish (ckb) due to Windows not having a ckb locale
        ([#20181](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20181)).
*   Windows using the ICC compiler:
    *   Source File Encoding. The ICC compiler does not recognize the
        [/utf-8](https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-c-compiler/topic/733662)
        option. A work-around is known and reported to succeed.
        ([#13251](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13251))
*   IBM z
    *   xlC C/C++ does not currently support a sufficient subset of C++11
        (#[13393](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13393))

## ICU4J Platform Support

ICU4J works on Java 7 and on Android API level 21.
