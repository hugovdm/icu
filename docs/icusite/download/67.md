# ICU 67

[TOC]

ICU is the [premier library for software
internationalization](http://site.icu-project.org/#TOC-What-is-ICU-), used by a
[wide array of companies and organizations](../home/index.md).

## Release Overview

ICU 67 updates to [CLDR 37](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-37)
locale data with many additions and corrections. This release also includes the
updates to [Unicode
13](http://blog.unicode.org/2020/03/announcing-unicode-standard-version-130.html),
subsuming the [special CLDR 36.1 and ICU 66
releases](http://blog.unicode.org/2020/03/icu-66-released.html). ICU 67 includes
many bug fixes for date and number formatting, including enhanced support for
user preferences in the locale identifier. The LocaleMatcher code and data are
improved, and number skeletons have a new “concise” form that can be used in
MessageFormat strings.

This is the first regular release after ICU 65. ICU 66 was a low-impact release
with just Unicode 13 and a few bug fixes.

For more details, including migration issues, see below.

error reports](../bugs.md).

## Version Number

The initial release has library version number 67.1.

If there are maintenance releases, they will be 67.2, 67.3, etc. (During ICU 67
development, the library version number was 67.0.x.)

Note: There may be additional commits on the
[maint-67](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/tree/maint/maint-67) branch that
are not included in the prepackaged download files.

*   Support for manipulating CLDR 37 unit identifiers in MeasureUnit.

## ICU4J Specific Changes

*   None

## Known Issues

### Common Issues

*   None yet.

### ICU4C

*   ICU4C requires C++11 support. Some platforms (such as IBM AIX, IBM z and
    Solaris) may no longer be able to build ICU until an improved compiler is
    available. See the "ICU4C Platform Support" section below.
*   ICU4C has known issues compiling with GCC on AIX. These are still being
    investigated ([ICU-3752](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-3752))
*   The object returned by ICU4C DecimalFormat#toNumberFormatter might have
    dangling pointers to the DecimalFormat, even when copied
    ([ICU-21134](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-21134))

### ICU4J

*   None yet.

## Migration Issues

1.  Constructing a StringPiece from NULL may be ambiguous, depending on the
    platform. Where this is a problem, please adjust call sites from using NULL
    to using nullptr.
    ([ICU-20984](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20984) [PR
    #1044](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/pull/1044))
    1.  This is similar to issues with the char16_t adoption in [ICU 59](59.md).
2.  ==**If** you rebuild the ICU locale data== from (possibly patched) CLDR
    data, note that there is a new CLDR-to-ICU converter tool in the ICU repo
    now, replacing the old one in the CLDR repo.
    ([ICU-20693](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20693)) See
    [icu4c/source/data/cldr-icu-readme.txt](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/maint/maint-67/icu4c/source/data/cldr-icu-readme.txt)

## ICU4C Platform Support

*   All: Compiler support for C++11 is required for building the ICU libraries.
    *   GCC: version 4.8 and later has been tested.
*   macOS: XCode 8.3 (LLVM clang 8.1.0) has been tested.
*   Solaris
    *   Use [Oracle Developer Studio 12.5 or
        later](https://blogs.oracle.com//solaris/entry/oracle_developer_studio_12_5)
    *   May not be supported.
        (#[13393](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13393))
    *   Unicode issues with some test files
        ([#13096](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13096)) (tests are not
        able to build)
    *   Time zone detection errors
        ([#13097](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13097))
*   Windows:
    *   The minimum supported version is Windows 7. Windows XP and Windows Vista
        are no longer supported.
    *   Building the Visual Studio UWP projects requires [Visual Studio
        2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) with a version of the
        [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads)
        installed.
    *   When using "@compat=host", on versions below Windows 10 version 1703, 6
        locales have date and number formatting issues
        ([#13119](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13119)).
    *   The LCID conversion APIs don't round-trip Kurdish (ku) and Central
        Kurdish (ckb) due to Windows not having a ckb locale
        ([#20181](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20181)).
    *   Initialization/deinitialization order of UMutex global statics is not
        defined on Visual Studio 2017 and below
        ([#21075](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-21075)). A
        work-around patch is available in [PR
        #1110](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/pull/1110).
    *   Builds using a prebuilt data file for ICU4C are broken. A fix is
        available in the
        [maint/maint-67](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/tree/maint/maint-67)
        branch ([#21150](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-21150)).
*   Windows using the ICC compiler:
    *   Source File Encoding. The ICC compiler does not recognize the
        [/utf-8](https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-c-compiler/topic/733662)
        option. A work-around is known and reported to succeed.
        ([#13251](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13251))
*   IBM AIX:
    *   xlC C/C++ does not currently support a sufficient subset of C++11
        (#[13393](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13393))
    *   gcc might work
*   IBM z
    *   xlC C/C++ does not currently support a sufficient subset of C++11
        (#[13393](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13393))
*   IBM platform C++ support
    *   IBM recently started including a build of Clang with their xlC compiler
        for z/OS and announced that this represents their future compiler
        strategy.
        <https://developer.ibm.com/linuxonpower/2020/02/23/ibm-c-c-and-fortran-compilers-to-adopt-llvm-open-source-infrastructure>.
    *   Dignus provides an LLVM based C and C++ compilers (including cross
        compilers) for z/OS that support C++14 and parts of C++17.
