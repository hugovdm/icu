# Download ICU 62

[TOC]

ICU is the [premier library for software
internationalization](http://site.icu-project.org/#TOC-What-is-ICU-), used by a
[wide array of companies and organizations](../home/index.md).

## Release Overview

ICU 62 upgrades to Unicode 11 and to CLDR 33.1 locale data. A locale-neutral
skeleton string can be used in MessageFormat for more control over number
formatting. Several still-draft NumberFormatter methods and helper classes have
been modified or renamed. In C++, DecimalFormat wraps the new NumberFormatter
code, and there is a new implementation for number and currency parsing.

For more details, including migration issues, see below.

Please use the [icu-support mailing list](../contacts.md) and/or [ICU
Trac](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/newticket) for error reports.

## Version Number

The initial release has library version number 62.1.

If there are maintenance releases, they will be 62.2, 62.3, etc. (During ICU 62
development, the library version number was 62.0.x.)

Note: There may be additional commits on the
[maint-62](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/tree/maint/maint-62) branch that
are not included in the prepackaged download files below.

## Common Changes

*   [Unicode
    11](http://blog.unicode.org/2018/06/announcing-unicode-standard-version-110.html):
    684 new characters, including 7 new scripts, Mtavruli Georgian capital
    letters, 5 new Han characters, and 66 new emoji characters.
*   [CLDR 33.1](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-33-1):
    *   Unicode 11 script metadata, collation, Chinese transliteration.
    *   Chinese collation stroke order updated from Unicode 7 to Unicode 11
        after tooling bug fixes.
*   NumberFormatter
    *   A NumberFormatter can now be constructed from a [locale-neutral skeleton
        string](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSFL8vmOQK5jEDNW5I5qD_nAPnZsfkDSaBBUxm_x7R0m4179dYE5e5fGSxB4Dr39PkRjbPbjHto9mD0/pub)
        (like a DateFormat)
        ([#8610](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/8610)). This is
        particularly useful in translated messages where placeholder details
        should not be translated. MessageFormat recognizes the style field as a
        number skeleton if it is prefixed with "::", as in "Number of files:
        {num, number, :: round-integer group-min2}."
        ([#13742](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13742))
    *   New "conversion" functions for getting a NumberFormatter from a
        DecimalFormat, and a Format from a NumberFormatter.
    *   New C API
        ([unicode/unumberformatter.h](http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4c/unumberformatter_8h.html).
        ([#13597](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13597)) Currently it
        supports formatting settings only via a skeleton string.
    *   Several still-draft NumberFormatter methods and helper classes have been
        modified or renamed; the previous versions remain temporarily (as
        deprecated) for at least one release, to help with the transition.
*   Break Iterator Rules: "Safe" rules are no longer required for correct break
    iterator operation. For back compatibility, existing rule sets containing
    safe rules will continue to work, with the safe rules they contain being
    ignored. The Break Iterator binary data format has been updated to reflect
    this change.
*   Line Break: The boundary rules have been updated to reflect the Unicode 11
    version of [UAX #14](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/). Specifically,
    the handling of Emoji ZWJ sequences has been improved.
    ([#13770](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13770))

## ICU4C Specific Changes

*   Under-the-hood overhaul of number parsing. See the [design
    doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRGRHf7Ga80UzrPxuqXUq67PR0491I7FFp2Ha7MbJaNy-WVLKWwJS_EMsS-7AraivDVsSAQ1aNyWC-L/pub)
    for a summary of changes; behavior is mostly compatible with previous
    versions, but there are some known differences.
*   DecimalFormat now wraps the new NumberFormatter code.

## ICU4J Specific Changes

*   (none)

## Known Issues

### Common Issues

*   Greek case conversion (upper / lower casing) can produce incorrect results.
    See [#13851](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13851) for details and
    a patch. (Note: This fix is included in the
    [maint-62](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/tree/maint/maint-62) branch).

### ICU4C

*   ICU4C requires C++11 support. Some platforms (such as IBM AIX, IBM z and
    Solaris) may no longer be able to build ICU until an improved compiler is
    available. See the "ICU4C Platform Support" section below.
*   DecimalFormat & CurrencyUnit used to accept not just NULL strings for "no
    currency" but (as an undocumented feature) also empty strings. Ticket
    [#13850](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13850) makes it accept
    empty currency code strings again.
*   Number formatting code crashes with unaligned memory access on (some?) ARM
    platforms. See [#20001](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20001)
    for details and a proposed fix.
*   In DecimalFormat.getCurrencyInstance when no currency is set, strings are
    formatted as "XXX 1.00" instead of "¤1.00" as in previous versions. This
    behavior will be changed back in 63.1. See
    [#13731](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13731) for details.
*   Cygwin unzip will not properly unpack the prebuilt Windows binaries
    ([#20567](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20567), fixed in
    64.2).

### ICU4J

*   When `TimeZone.TIMEZONE_JDK` is set as the time zone type, time zone format
    for Europe/Dublin becomes incorrect ("Irish Standard Timen" and "Greenwich
    Mean Time" are swapped) on the latest Oracle and OpenJDK runtime
    ([#13798](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13798)).

## Migration Issues

1.  The fix to insert whitespace between certain currency symbols and numbers
    may need "golden data" tests to be modified
    [#6560](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/6560)
2.  The [Unicode 11.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/#Migration)
    changes may also require some code/tests to be fixed. Notably:
    1.  Word break now groups white space together.
    2.  Segmentation in general simplifies tests for emoji sequences.
    3.  Casing behaves differently for Georgian, and differently for that than
        for any other script.

## ICU4C Platform Support

*   All: Compiler support for C++11 is required for building the ICU libraries.
    *   GCC: version 4.8 and later has been tested.
*   IBM AIX:
    *   xlC C/C++ does not currently support a sufficient subset of C++11
        (#[13393](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13393))
    *   gcc might work
*   macOS: XCode 8.3 (LLVM clang 8.1.0) has been tested.
*   Solaris
    *   Use [Oracle Developer Studio 12.5 or
        later](https://blogs.oracle.com//solaris/entry/oracle_developer_studio_12_5)
    *   May not be supported.
        (#[13393](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13393))
    *   Unicode issues with some test files
        ([#13096](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13096)) (tests are not
        able to build)
    *   Time zone detection errors
        ([#13097](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13097))
*   Windows:
    *   The minimum supported version is Windows 7. Windows XP and Windows Vista
        are no longer supported.
    *   Building the Visual Studio UWP projects requires [Visual Studio
        2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) with a version of the
        [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads)
        installed.
    *   Note: There have been reports of issues with the optimizer in Visual
        Studio 2017 (for example
        #[13636](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13636)). If you run
        into issues with VS2017 you may wish to use VS2015 as a work-around.
    *   When using "@compat=host", on versions below Windows 10 version 1703, 6
        locales have date and number formatting issues
        ([#13119](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13119)).
*   Windows using the ICC compiler:
    *   Source File Encoding. The ICC compiler does not recognize the
        [/utf-8](https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-c-compiler/topic/733662)
        option. A work-around is known and reported to succeed.
        ([#13251](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13251))
*   IBM z
    *   xlC C/C++ does not currently support a sufficient subset of C++11
        (#[13393](https://ssl.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13393))
