    *   New UCA data for collation/sorting
        ([#7264](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/review/7264)), with
        refinements from CLDR; this data is revamped for more effective use of
        collation weights, and noncharacters are now handled
        ([#8007](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/8007)).
    *   Support for over 2,088 characters, including the new *emoji* and Indian

    from the recently tagged [CLDR 1.9 release candidate
    2](http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/milestone/1.9RC). The CLDR release contains
    numerous improvements and bug fixes approved by the CLDR committee, mainly
    in the areas of collation sequences and in available date formats
    ([#8156](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/8156)).

*   Alternate number symbols based on numbering system
    ([#7599](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/7599)).
*   Compact collation tailoring syntax for reduced memory and disk footprint
    ([#7015](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/7015)).
*   New collation \[import\] rule for reduced footprint and improved maintenance
    ([#7023](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/7023)).
*   Fast string BiDi direction detection
    ([#7772](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/7772)).

#### ICU4C Specific Changes

    for more details ([#7455](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/7455)).
*   [pkg-config](http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/wiki/) files for a standard
    way of linking against ICU
    (#[6981](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/6981)).
*   Promotion to @draft (from @internal) for most regex functions that provide
    access via UText ([#8102](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/8102)).
*   Regex support for a "find progress" callback
    ([#7666](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/7666)).
*   Enhance regex APIs to support full 64-bit offsets and indices
    ([#7813](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/7813)).

    ([#7949](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/7949)).
