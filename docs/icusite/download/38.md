### Description

ICU is the premier library for software internationalization. ICU 3.8 is a major
reference release of ICU, with new features, new APIs, and many bug fixes in
data and code.

Major changes in ICU 3.8 include the following:

*   **Common Changes**
    *   **Locale Data**: ICU uses and supports data from [Common Locale Data
        Repository (CLDR)
        1.5.0.1](http://www.unicode.org/press/pr-cldr1.5.html), which includes
        many improvements in quality and quantity of data.
    *   **Rule Based Time Zone**: This set of classes provides the ability to
        read and write time zone data in RFC2445 VTIMEZONE format. This also
        provides access Olson timezone transitions.
    *   **Timezone Formatting**: This has changed to give more human readable
        results.
    *   **Relative Date/Time Formatting**: A draft of the relative date/time
        format class has been added. This functionality can be accessed through
        the DateFormat::createDateInstance or DateFormat.getInstance factory
        method. It provides the ability to format localized dates in terms of
        "yesterday", "today" and "tomorrow", instead of a specific only date or
        time.
    *   **Demonstrations and Tools**
        *   **[ICU Data Library
            Customizer](http://apps.icu-project.org/datacustom/)**: This new
            online tool provides an easier way customize ICU's data.
        *   **[ICU4J Demonstrations](http://icu-project.org/icu4jdemos.html)**:
            These will demonstrate some features of ICU4J, like calendars,
            transliteration, and several other features.
*   **ICU4C Specific Changes**
    *   **Flexible Date/Time Formatting**: A draft of flexible date/time format
        generator has been added. This allows multiple date and time format
        patterns to be generated that are valid for specific locales. This
        funtionality can be accessed through the DateTimePatternGenerator API.
    *   **Time Zones**: The default time zone is detected more accurately on
        Unix machines.
    *   **Additional Calendars**
        *   **@calendar=taiwan**: This calendar is a variant of the Gregorian
            calendar used in Taiwan.
        *   **@calendar=indian**: This is the Indian national calendar.
        *   **@calendar=persian**: This is the Persian calendar. It is also
            known as the JalƒÅli Calendar. It is used in several Arabic
            countries.
    *   **UnicodeSet**
        *   The Freezable design pattern is now supported, which can improve
            performance for the contains() and span() methods on frozen
            UnicodeSet objects.
        *   A span function was added for iterating through strings.
        *   The containsAll(string) and containsNone(string) now support set
            strings, instead of only codepoints.
    *   **Performance**
        *   Charset conversion performance has been enhanced. The amount of
            improvement varies depending on the converter being used and
            platform being used.
        *   Rule based transliterator construction performance has been
            improved.
*   **ICU4J Specific Changes**
    *   **Additional Calendars**
        *   **@calendar=taiwan**: This calendar is a variant of the Gregorian
            calendar used in Taiwan.
        *   **@calendar=indian**: This is the Indian national calendar.
    *   **Charset Conversion**
        *   The ICU4J implementation of java.nio.charset.Charset is included as
            a Technology Preview. [Use with caution.](#ICU4J_issues)
        *   CESU-8, UTF-7 and ISCII converters have been ported from ICU4C to
            ICU4J.
        *   Several bugs involving proper mapping of characters to or from a
            charset have been fixed.
        *   Performance has been improved for several converters.
    *   **BiDi**: A new BiDi implementation was added.
    *   **PluralFormat**: This new MessageFormat type was added. This
        functionality is helpful for Eastern European languages that have
        different plural inflections of a word at regular intervals of a
        described quantity.
    *   **DurationFormat**: This new implementation can format a duration in
        time such as "2 hours, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds".
    *   **MessageFormat named arguments**: Arguments can now be named in
        MessageFormat.

#### Platform Installation Notes

Please be sure to view the
[readme.html](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/tags/release-3-8-1/readme.html)
that is included in ICU. Most installation questions can be answered there. The
z/OS (OS/390)
[unpax-icu.sh](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/tags/release-3-8-1/as_is/os390/unpax-icu.sh)
script is required to unpackage the compressed tar file on z/OS, and the i5/OS
(OS/400)
[unpax-icu.sh](http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/tags/release-3-8-1/as_is/os400/unpax-icu.sh)
script is required to unpackage the compressed file on i5/OS.

The ICU4C 3.8 source downloads contains a pre-built .dat data archive with ICU's
data rather than the data source files. This is to simplify the build process
for the majority of users and to reduce platform porting issues. If you need the
data source files for customization, then please download the ICU source code
from [SubVersion repository](/repository/). If you need to remove data from
ICU's data library, you can also consider using the new icupkg tool to modify
the data built into ICU.

#### Known Issues, Bugs and Patches

As a byproduct, the behavior of date formatting and parsing has changed in ways
that may requiring recoding on your part depending on your usage. For more
information, see [Formatting Dates and Times](/userguide/formatDateTime.html) in
the User Guide.

As a byproduct, the behavior of date formatting and parsing has changed in ways
that may requiring recoding on your part depending on your usage. For more
information, see [Formatting Dates and Times](/userguide/formatDateTime.html) in
the User Guide.

Starting in 2008 one of ICU4J's tests started failing. The failing test
(ICU/Duration/ICUDurationTest/TestBasics) does not affect library code. To fix
the failing test, you can [patch](patch.html) your copy of ICU4J with this
[patch to the
test](http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/changeset/23149?format=diff).

The ICU4J implementation of java.nio.charset.Charset is included as a Technology
Preview. Not all functionality from the java.nio.Charset interfaces is
operational, and some converters are known to mis-handle Unicode supplementary
characters. Use with caution.
