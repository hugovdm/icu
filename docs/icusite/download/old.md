## Old ICU Releases

The following are available for reference. For current development, please use
the latest release. If you already use ICU, then please upgrade regularly, so
that you get newer versions of Unicode and locale data, as well as many bug
fixes.

### Official Releases

If you want to use ICU (as opposed to developing it), it is recommended that you
download an official packaged version of the ICU source code. These versions are
tested more thoroughly than day-to-day development builds of the system, and
they are packaged in zip and tar files for convenient download. Here are several
recent releases of ICU that are available:
